/**
 * Scores submitted text for machine-generated nonsense ("Cowqv Exnjznedy", "dQgJlwEhfxaLZSKYLy").
 *
 * This class is deliberately free of WordPress: no settings, no database, no globals. The
 * heuristic is the part of this feature that can be *wrong*, and a pure function is the only
 * shape in which it can be run against a few hundred real submissions to find out.
 *
 * ## What it detects
 *
 * Exactly one thing: tokens produced by a random-character generator. It has no idea what a
 * language is and makes no attempt to find out. Grammatically plausible spam ("great site,
 * here is my SEO offer") sails straight through — that is the keyword blacklist's job.
 *
 * ## The three signals
 *
 * - **PRONOUNCE** — a low vowel ratio *or* a long consonant run. These two measurements are
 *   deliberately fused into one signal because they are not independent: both describe how
 *   pronounceable a token is, and German compounds trip both at once. Counting them separately
 *   was the first design and it flagged `Rechnungsanschrift`, an entirely ordinary word.
 * - **CASE_MIX** — upper/lower transitions inside a token. The cleanest marker by far:
 *   generators emit `dQgJlwEh` constantly, humans essentially never do. The threshold sits at
 *   four rather than three because CamelCase brand names ("WordPress", "McDonalds",
 *   "SilentShield") all score exactly three.
 * - **BIGRAM** — mean letter-pair plausibility against {@see BIGRAM_CLASSES}. This is the only
 *   signal that catches all-lowercase gibberish, which the other two miss by construction.
 *
 * Two of the three must agree. Measured on the sample that motivated this feature, the spam
 * tokens score 4.4–6.0 on BIGRAM while real words — including `Brzeczyszczykiewicz` and
 * `Krankenversicherung` — score 6.75–8.9.
 *
 * ## Why Latin-only
 *
 * A vowel ratio is meaningless for a script that does not write vowels, and a case switch is
 * meaningless for a script without case. Fed Chinese, Arabic or Hebrew, PRONOUNCE and BIGRAM
 * would fire on every single token and this class would block an entire language. Non-Latin
 * tokens are therefore skipped outright, which means Cyrillic gibberish is not detected
 * either. That is the honest trade: silence beats confidently blocking Japanese.
