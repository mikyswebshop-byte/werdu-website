/**
 * Rejects submissions whose text is machine-generated nonsense.
 *
 * Every other module in this plugin verifies something the *client* was asked to return — a
 * captcha answer, a timestamp, a signed token, an untouched honeypot. All of them share one
 * assumption: that a bot cannot read the page it is submitting. A bot driving a real browser
 * breaks that assumption for all of them at once, which is exactly what happened on the
 * installation that prompted this module: the honeypot was skipped because it sits off-screen,
 * and the maths captcha was solved because it is rendered as text in the DOM.
 *
 * This module looks at what the bot *produced* instead. Emitting random strings is the point
 * of a filler-spam run, so it cannot be optimised away without writing real prose.
 *
 * ## Modes
 *
 * `monitor` (the default) scores every submission and records what it would have done, without
 * affecting the outcome. `block` rejects. Monitoring first is deliberate: a wrongly blocked
 * enquiry costs a customer, and the thresholds deserve real traffic before they are trusted.
 *
 * @see Gibberish_Scorer for the heuristic itself and why it is shaped the way it is.
