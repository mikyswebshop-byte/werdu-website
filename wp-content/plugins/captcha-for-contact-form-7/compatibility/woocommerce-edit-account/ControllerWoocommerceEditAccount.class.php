/**
 * The WooCommerce "Account details" form.
 *
 * Less obviously a spam target than a contact form, and worth protecting for a different
 * reason: it changes the e-mail address and password of an account that is already logged in.
 * A session hijacked through a stolen cookie is one submission away from becoming a permanent
 * takeover, and every captcha here is a step an automated script has to solve rather than
 * replay.
 *
 * Note that this only ever runs for logged-in visitors, and the plugin whitelists logged-in
 * users by default (`protection_whitelist_role_logged_in`). A site owner who wants this
 * protection has to turn that whitelist off — which is the correct default for both settings,
 * but it does mean enabling this module alone changes nothing.
