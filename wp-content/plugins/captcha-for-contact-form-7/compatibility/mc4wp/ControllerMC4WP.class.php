/**
 * MC4WP: Mailchimp for WordPress — newsletter signup forms.
 *
 * Signup forms are a heavier spam target than contact forms and the damage is different: a
 * contact form delivers junk to an inbox, a signup form injects junk addresses into a mailing
 * list, where hard bounces and spam-trap hits degrade the sender reputation of every later
 * campaign. MC4WP ships a honeypot of its own (`_mc4wp_honeypot`) and a timestamp, which stop
 * the bots that fill every field blindly and nothing else.
 *
 * No JavaScript module is needed. MC4WP's frontend posts the form natively — only its admin
 * scripts use XHR — so the global fallback in JavaScriptProtection stamps `js_end_time` on
 * submit and on submit-button click without any help from here.
